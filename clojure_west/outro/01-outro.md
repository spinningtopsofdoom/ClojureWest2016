## Future possibilities

- Merge and Diff operations could have greatly increased performance
- Similar to RRB Vectors for Vectors

!SLIDE

## CHAMP shows Hash Maps have plenty of room at the bottom

- 2x perf for iteration
- 10 - 100x perf for equality checking
- Lower memory overhead

!SLIDE

## For me biggest win is making Hash Maps much easier to understand and implement

!SLIDE

## Clojure Hash Maps have already been exported to many languages

- Scala (base hash map)
- Elixir (base hash map)
- Haskell (unordered-containers)
- Ruby (hamster)
- JavaScript (immutable.js)
