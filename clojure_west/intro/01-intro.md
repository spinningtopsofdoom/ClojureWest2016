## CHAMP gives you guaranteed Hash Map performance gains

- Iteration by 2x
- Equality checking by 10x to 100x

## CHAMP will trim the flab from your Hash Maps

## getting them from **(** to **{**

You don't need a wizard degree in black magic bit twiddling

CHAMP makes Hash Maps more wieldy, making them both simpler and easier

Code size is two thirds the size of the original implementation
